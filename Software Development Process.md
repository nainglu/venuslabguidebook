# Development Process
## Working With SCRUM
Scrum is one of the useful Agile Methodologies that we will be using in our development process. 
To create backlogs and plan scrums, we will be using [JIRA](https://venuslab.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa). 
### The People and Parts of Scrum
To understand Scrum, developer needs to know the people and parts of the framework. 
Let’s break down the pieces and parts that make Scrum happen:

- Scrum starts with a [Product Owner](). This is the person who represents the final user’s best interest, and has the authority to say what goes into the final product.
- That Product Owner is in charge of making the [Backlog](), a list of tasks and requirements the final product needs. Here’s an important part: The backlog MUST be prioritized. That’s the job of the Product Owner. 
- Next up is the [Sprint](). A Sprint is a predetermined timeframe within which the team completes sets of tasks from the Backlog. The length of time depends on the needs of the team, but two weeks is pretty typical.
- Teams meet every day to give progress updates in the [Daily Scrum](). Many people also call these “Daily Stand-Ups.”
- Each Sprint ends with a review, or [Retrospective](), where the team reviews their work and discusses ways to improve the next Sprint.

### Creating Backlog
The Backlog is where we list out everything the project needs, ordered by importance. Keep in mind that the Backlog is never complete. The Product Owner or Project Leader will take responsible for this.

### Sprint Planning
A Sprint is a predetermined timeframe within which the team completes sets of tasks from the Backlog. The length of time depends on the needs of the team, but two weeks is pretty typical.
At the morning of Friday every week, we will review the previous sprint and plan for next sprint. The sprint duration is now set to 1 week at the moment.

### During the Sprint
In our sprints, there will be five major list to track the development process. They are:
- Backlog 
    - Backlog is to keep the tasks to be worked on. Product Owner or Project Leader will create the tasks that need help with.
- To Do
    - This is the list to be worked on during the current sprint.
- Doing 
    - The assigned ninja will have to move the card what he is doing to the Doing list from To Do list.
- QC Test
    - When the assigned ninja once he's done with a task, the card should be moved to QC Test list. The Tester or Technical Director will check if the task is properly done or that will be moved back to Doing list.
- Done
    - The tasks passed the QC test will be ready to shipped and moved here to the Done list.
