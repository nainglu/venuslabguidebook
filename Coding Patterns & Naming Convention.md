# Coding Patterns & Naming Convention
### Assigning Variables
- Use meaningful and understandale names. It's ok to be long if it is necessary.
- A Variable name should represent the object type. 
    - Web Front-end developer will have to use following convention.


| Type | Initial | Example |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| Label | lbl | lblUsername |
| Input | ipt | iptUsername |
| Button | btn | btnSubmit |
| Table | tbl | tblDataForm |
| Select | slt | sltCities |
| Option | opt | optYangon |

- Use CamelCase.
- Database table names should be plural e.g: students.
- Model name should be singular e.g: Student.
- Controller name should be plural e.g: StudentsController.

### Commenting
Due to time restrictions or enthusiastic programmers who want immediate results for their code, commenting of code often takes a back seat. Programmers working as a team have found it better to leave comments behind since coding usually follows cycles, or more than one person may work on a particular module. However, some commenting can decrease the cost of knowledge transfer between developers working on the same module.
Developers should leave the following: 

- Name of the module
- Purpose of the Module
- Description of the Module
- Original Author
- Modifications
- Developers who modified code with a description on why it was modified.

### Keep the code simple
The code that a programmer writes should be simple. Complicated logic for achieving a simple thing should be kept to a minimum since the code might be modified by another programmer in the future. The logic one programmer implemented may not make perfect sense to another. So, always keep the code as simple as possible.

### Test Cases
Mostly every program Venus Lab Ninjas wrote should have Test Cases.
